## MagiReco
A small Monte Carlo simulation of gacha rolls in the mobile game Magia Record. Simulates the average number of rolls required to obtain N copies of an event character, along with a 99.9% confidence interval. Also returns the average number of "spooks", or SSR draws that are _not_ the event character, along with an 99.9% confidence interval.
